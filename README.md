# Rick and Morty App
This is an app where user can search for their favorite characters of this amazing series and know more about them.

To build it I used the [rick and morty api](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation)

## This is what you have to do if you want to see what I did: 

- make setup
- make start (cross fingers ðŸ˜¬)
- Also you can watch it on [live mode](https://rick-and-morty-app-6636b.web.app/)
- make test (If you want to run test)

## Notes

I really liked working on this challenge, because I used the latest react stuff and it helped me learn new things that I can use from now on. 

What was most complicated for me was to configure the routes from 0 and be able to configure the deploy to be watch it in real time but also was interesting working with this because I like Rick and Morty and I felt familiar whit ðŸ˜¬
